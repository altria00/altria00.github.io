## About Me

I am currently a Master's student at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS). My research interests lie in **computer vision**, with a primary focus on **small object detection in remote sensing imagery**. My work aims to improve the accuracy and robustness of detecting tiny targets under complex aerial and satellite imaging conditions, addressing challenges such as scale variation, background clutter, and limited spatial information.

My research combines deep learning–based detection frameworks with efficient feature representation and multi-scale modeling techniques, with the goal of advancing practical applications in intelligent remote sensing analysis.

More information will be added soon.
